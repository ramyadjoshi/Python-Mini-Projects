🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. Two players can play against each other in this interactive version of the timeless game.
📋 Features

Interactive GUI: Clean, user-friendly interface built with Tkinter
Two-Player Mode: Alternating turns between X and O players
Win Detection: Automatic detection of wins (rows, columns, diagonals)
Tie Detection: Recognizes when the game ends in a draw
Visual Feedback: Clear display of moves and game status
Game Reset: Easy restart functionality

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.6+
Tkinter: For GUI development
messagebox: For win/tie notifications

📦 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher
Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

Running the Game

Ensure you have Python installed on your system
Download or clone the tic-tac-toe.py file
Run the game:
bashpython tic-tac-toe.py


🎯 How to Play

Starting the Game: Run the script to open the game window
Making Moves: Click on any empty cell in the 3x3 grid
Player Turns:

Player 1 starts with 'X'
Player 2 follows with 'O'
Players automatically alternate turns


Winning: Get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
Tie Game: If all cells are filled without a winner, it's a tie
Game Over: A popup will announce the winner or tie

🧩 Code Structure
Key Components
Game State Management
pythonstates = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]  # Tracks game state
Player1 = 'X'  # Current player
stop_game = False  # Game status flag
Main Functions

clicked(r, c): Handles button clicks and player moves
check_if_win(): Checks for win conditions and ties
GUI Setup: Creates 3x3 button grid using Tkinter

Win Conditions

Rows: Three identical symbols in any row
Columns: Three identical symbols in any column
Diagonals: Three identical symbols in main or anti-diagonal

🎮 Game Logic Flow

Player clicks on an empty cell
System places player's symbol (X or O)
System switches to the other player
System checks for win conditions:

Check all rows for three-in-a-row
Check all columns for three-in-a-row
Check both diagonals for three-in-a-row


If no win, check for tie (board full)
Display result and stop game

🔧 Customization Options
Visual Modifications

Button Size: Modify height and width parameters
Font: Change font=("Helvetica", "20") to your preferred font
Colors: Add bg and fg parameters to buttons

Gameplay Modifications

Different Board Size: Modify the range in loops (currently 3x3)
Different Symbols: Change 'X' and 'O' to other characters
AI Player: Add computer player logic

🐛 Error Handling

Occupied Cell: Prevents overwriting already filled cells
Game Over: Disables further moves after game ends
Invalid Moves: Only allows clicks on valid, empty cells

📚 Learning Concepts
This project demonstrates:

GUI Programming: Creating interactive interfaces with Tkinter
Event Handling: Responding to user clicks
Game Logic: Implementing rules and win conditions
2D Arrays: Managing game state with nested lists
Conditional Logic: Complex if-else statements for win detection
Function Design: Breaking code into reusable functions
Global Variables: Managing game state across functions

🚀 Possible Enhancements

Single Player Mode: Add AI opponent with different difficulty levels
Score Tracking: Keep track of wins across multiple games
Custom Themes: Different color schemes and visual styles
Sound Effects: Add audio feedback for moves and wins
Larger Grids: Support for 4x4, 5x5 boards
Network Play: Allow online multiplayer functionality
Game History: Save and replay previous games
Animated Moves: Add visual transitions for moves

🎯 Difficulty Level
Beginner: Perfect for those learning:

Basic Python syntax
