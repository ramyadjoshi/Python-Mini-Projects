🪄 Invisibility Cloak
An advanced computer vision project that creates a Harry Potter-style invisibility cloak effect using Python. This application uses real-time video processing to make objects of a specific color (red) appear invisible by replacing them with a pre-captured background.
📋 Features

Real-time Video Processing: Live camera feed with instant background replacement
Color Detection: Advanced HSV color space detection for red objects
Background Capture: Capture and store background for invisibility effect
Morphological Operations: Image processing for smooth cloak detection
Interactive GUI: User-friendly Tkinter interface
Multi-threaded: Smooth video processing without GUI freezing

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.7+
OpenCV: Computer vision and image processing
NumPy: Numerical operations and array manipulation
PIL (Pillow): Image handling and conversion
Tkinter: GUI development
Threading: Concurrent video processing

📦 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or higher
Webcam or camera device
Red colored cloth/object for the cloak effect

Required Packages
Install the required packages using pip:
bashpip install opencv-python numpy Pillow
Hardware Requirements

Camera: Built-in or external webcam
Red Cloth: Solid red colored fabric or clothing
Good Lighting: Adequate lighting for color detection
Stable Background: Non-moving background for best results

🎯 How to Use
Step-by-Step Guide

Launch Application:
bashpython cloak.py

Position Yourself: Stand in front of the camera without the red cloak
Capture Background: Click "Capture Background" button and wait for confirmation
Wear the Cloak: Put on your red cloth/clothing
Enjoy the Effect: Watch as the red areas become invisible!
Stop Application: Click "Stop" button to exit

Important Tips

Solid Red Color: Use bright, solid red colored materials
Avoid Red in Background: Remove other red objects from the scene
Good Lighting: Ensure adequate lighting for color detection
Steady Position: Keep relatively still during background capture

🧩 Technical Implementation
Core Computer Vision Concepts
Color Space Conversion
pythonhsv = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

Converts from BGR to HSV color space for better color detection
HSV is more robust for color-based segmentation

Red Color Detection
pythonlower_red1 = np.array([0, 100, 50])
upper_red1 = np.array([10, 255, 255])
lower_red2 = np.array([170, 100, 50])
upper_red2 = np.array([180, 255, 255])

Red color spans across 0° and 180° in HSV hue channel
Two ranges capture complete red spectrum

Morphological Operations
pythonmask = cv2.morphologyEx(mask, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8), iterations=2)
mask = cv2.dilate(mask, np.ones((3, 3), np.uint8), iterations=1)

Opening: Removes noise and small objects
Dilation: Fills gaps and smooths edges

Background Replacement
pythoncloak_area = cv2.bitwise_and(self.bg, self.bg, mask=mask)
non_cloak_area = cv2.bitwise_and(frame, frame, mask=mask_inv)
output = cv2.addWeighted(cloak_area, 1, non_cloak_area, 1, 0)

Separates cloak and non-cloak regions
Combines background and current frame selectively

Application Architecture
Class Structure
pythonclass InvisibilityCloakApp:
    def __init__(self, master):
        # GUI setup and camera initialization
    
    def capture_background(self):
        # Background capture logic
    
    def video_loop(self):
        # Main video processing thread
    
    def stop(self):
        # Application cleanup
Threading Implementation

Main Thread: Handles GUI interactions
Video Thread: Processes camera feed continuously
Synchronization: Thread-safe operations for smooth performance

🔧 Configuration & Customization
Color Range Adjustment
Modify these values to detect different colors:
python# For blue cloak
lower_blue = np.array([100, 100, 50])
upper_blue = np.array([130, 255, 255])

# For green cloak  
lower_green = np.array([50, 100, 50])
upper_green = np.array([70, 255, 255])
Processing Parameters
python# Morphological operation kernel size
kernel = np.ones((5, 5), np.uint8)  # Larger for smoother results

# Number of iterations
iterations = 3  # More iterations for cleaner masks
Background Capture Settings
python# Number of frames to capture for stable background
for _ in range(100):  # Increase for more stable background
    ret, bg = self.cap.read()
